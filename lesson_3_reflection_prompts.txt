When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I feel like using remote repository all the time because it backup in the cloud all the time
    it can test on live website anytime, people working on the same project can see the progress too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

    when there is more than one developers in the team, each one of them may create different branch and edition
    ,hence manual pull allow us to pull the branches that we needed only.
