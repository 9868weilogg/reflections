When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I feel like using remote repository all the time because it backup in the cloud all the time
    it can test on live website anytime, people working on the same project can see the progress too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    when there is more than one developers in the team, each one of them may create different branch and edition
    ,hence manual pull allow us to pull the branches that we needed only.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: cloning somebody's repo to my repo but i cannot make changes on information of somebody's repo but is ok for the forked in my repo. I fork the code from other ppl so that I can edit it for my own use.
    Clone: clone mean I have all the history, and I can modified the history too. Clone mean I clone the code from each source and it now became my code.
    Branch : I can add branches at my own repo and save as commit. I create it myself not from others.
