The repo is empty and not commit. I need it to save my commits and history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

staging area containes the file or files that may be interdependent when I am editing them.
It is intermediate component of working directory and repository. I select files need from WD and add them into staging area
to process and create commits of these files in repo.
Value is that I can choose whatever files that I needed to place into staging area and remove when it is not needed before 
saving the commit.

change?
